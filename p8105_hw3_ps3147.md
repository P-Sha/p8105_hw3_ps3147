## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by a user. There are user
/ order variables: user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables: name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

Plot of \#of items in each aisle, for aisles with more than 10,000
items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Table of 3 most popular items in given aisles.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits" )) %>% 
   group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
   mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |

Table of mean hour of the day for order of given two products:Apples vs
ice cream

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

Read and tidy the accelerometer data.

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
   pivot_longer(
    activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "min_of_the_day",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  )  %>% 
  mutate(
    min_of_the_day = as.numeric(min_of_the_day),
    day = factor(day)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
  day_type = recode(day,"Saturday" = "weekend", "Sunday" = "weekend", "Monday" = "weekday", "Tuesday" = "weekday","Wednesday" = "weekday","Thursday" = "weekday","Friday" = "weekday")
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
accel_df =
   mutate(accel_df,
   day = fct_relevel(day, "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```

This dataset based on “accelerometer data” contains 50400 rows and 6
columns. The dataset consists information on 5 weeks of recorded
activity counts based on an accelerometer activity, by the minute of
each day. The activity count ranges from 1 to 8982.

Table of activity per day.

``` r
accel_df %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
    summarize(total_daily_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day",
    values_from = "total_daily_activity"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 8
    ## # Groups:   week [5]
    ##    week Sunday  Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  Friday Saturday
    ##   <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1     1 631105  78828. 307094.   340115.  355924. 480543.   376254
    ## 2     2 422018 295431  423245    440962   474048  568839    607175
    ## 3     3 467052 685910  381507    468869   371230  467420    382928
    ## 4     4 260617 409450  319568    434460   340291  154049      1440
    ## 5     5 138421 389080  367824    445366   549658  620860      1440

There seems to be least activity on Saturdays in weeks 4 and 5. Middle
of the weeks on Tuesdays through Thursdays showed the most consistent
high activity counts.

Graph of 24-hr activity for each day.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
   group_by(day_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = min_of_the_day, y = activity_count, color = day)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = .4) + 
  labs(
    title = "Activity plot",
    x = "Minutes of the day",
    y = "Activity count"
     ) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = day), se = FALSE)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_ps3147_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

    ## List of 1
    ##  $ legend.position: chr "bottom"
    ##  - attr(*, "class")= chr [1:2] "theme" "gg"
    ##  - attr(*, "complete")= logi FALSE
    ##  - attr(*, "validate")= logi TRUE

The graphs seems fairly consistent in pattern for all given days in a
week. Starting at 0 min, indicating midnight, there seems to be minimal
activity count up to roughly 6- 7am. Activity seems to peak in the
morning hours, and the again late in the evening. There were a few days
with more daytime activity tha usual.

## Problem 3

Read “NY NOAA” data

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

This weather related data is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Association (NOAA). The data consists of 2595176 rows of observations on
7 variables. It is organized by weather stations, listed by their ID
numbers. Each station has data for precipitation, snow, depth of snow,
maximum and minimum temperatures for various years, although many of
these records are missing since stations are not required to collect
information on all variables. These large amounts of missing data could
make comparisons and other summary tasks challenging.

Tidy data.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  ) 
month_df = mutate(month_df, month = as.character(month))

noaa_df = 
ny_noaa %>% 
   separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
   mutate(
     month = as.character(month),
     tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
     tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
     tmin = tmin / 10,            
     tmax = tmax / 10
    )

noaa_df =
   left_join(noaa_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
   mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
   select(-month_name)
```

Most commonly observed values for snowfall.

``` r
noaa_df %>% 
  na.omit() %>%  
  count(snow) %>%  
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(
    rank = min_rank(desc(n))
  ) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ##    snow       n  rank
    ##   <int>   <int> <int>
    ## 1     0 1112758     1
    ## 2    25   15809     2
    ## 3    13   12460     3

Highest value of 0 mm snowfall being records of snow during summer and
other non-snow months in NY, followed by 25mm and then 13mm of recorded
snowfall.

Two-panel plot.

``` r
noaa_df %>%
   filter(month %in% c("January", "July")) %>% 
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  drop_na(tmax) %>% 
   mutate(
    mean_tmax = mean(tmax)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, group = id, color = id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  facet_grid(.~ month) +
  labs(title = "average maximum temperatures for January and July", x = "year", y = "average maximum temperature (C)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_ps3147_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

The plot shows distinct difference between the average maximum
temperatures in January and July over all the weather stations, every
year. As expected ,average temperature in January was much lower than in
July. Other than the two colder than usual recording in January of early
1980’s and 2005, and again in two different years in July, the
temperatures were fairly consistent between a certain range.

Plot: tmax vs tmin, and yearly snowfall.

``` r
tmax_tmin_plot =
noaa_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = id)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "maximum versus minimum recorded temperatures", x = "minimum temperatures (C)", y = "maximum temperatures (C)") +
   theme(legend.position = "none")

snowfall_plot = 
  noaa_df %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
   filter(snow > 0) %>%
  filter(snow < 100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = snow, color = year)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Yearly snowfall", x = "Year", y = "snowfall (mm)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
tmax_tmin_plot / snowfall_plot
```
